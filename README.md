## Hellow, World ðŸ‘‹

I'm learning about applying artificial intelligence to disease diagnosis. I am particularly interested in multimodal models, where information from multiple medical devices can be combined to better assess a patient's condition. I am also fascinated by generative models, especially their potential for augmenting limited datasets to improve model training. In addition, I am drawn to explainable AI (XAI), as I believe that interpreting and explaining AI decision-making is essential for building trust in medical applications.
